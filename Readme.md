# Alt-BN128 BLS

A BLS library over BN254 (alt_bn128) for Solana. It places signatures in G1 and public keys in G2, uses Solana’s bn128 syscalls, supports single-signing, signature aggregation. 

This is a fork of Dean Little’s excellent [`solana-alt-bn128-bls`](https://github.com/deanmlittle/solana-alt-bn128-bls).
